They come to us in a mix of colors and styles, therefore we cannot fill orders for specific colors.  All have either 10 or 12 pages and both the covers and bindings are intact.

<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>New Custom 10" White 78 RPM Sleeves</FONT></H3></CENTER>
Sorry, sold out!</P>


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Used Heavy Duty 10" Brown 78 RPM Sleeves</FONT></H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="brown sleeves.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
These are the old style brown cardboard sleeves that are not made anymore.  They offer excellent protection for your favorite records, and will fit most of the early fat Columbia discs as well as Edison Diamond Discs.  All these sleeves are used; therefore they will have various markings and stickers from their previous owners, but all are in good shape and are quite serviceable.  They look great lined up on a shelf and can easily be labeled to identify the records.  Our supply is limited, so order as many as you need while we have them in stock.  They are available in packs of 50 for $20.00 plus $6.00 shipping to any USA address.  Overseas buyers should contact us before ordering so we can quote a shipping charge based on their country of residence.  Each pack of 50 sleeves weighs about 6 pounds.  Use the printable order form on the <A HREF="recsup.html">Record Supplies</A> page and write in "Used Heavy Duty Sleeves."</P>


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Fibre Needles</FONT></H3></CENTER>
<P>Sorry, sold out!</P>


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Soft Tone Needles</FONT></H3></CENTER>
We are now offering excellent quality soft tone steel needles for Victrolas and other acoustic phonographs.  They are made by the same company that produces our regular tone needles, and we recommend them highly to those who are seeking a more subdued tone from their phonographs.  Go to the <A HREF="recsup.html">Record Supplies</A> page for a further description and a printable order form.</P> 


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Strobe Discs</FONT></H3></CENTER>
Have you ever wondered if your hand wound disc phonograph is running at exactly the right speed?  The most reliable way to test it is to use a strobe disc, and we are now offering a disc that works for both 78 rpm and 80 rpm phonographs.  All you need is a florescent light that runs on 60 cycles (in the USA, that's standard).  Incandescent bulbs may also work, depending on the ambient light conditions in the room.  Instructions are included with the disc.  You can see a further description of this item and order it on our <A HREF="recsup.html">Record Supplies</A> page.</P>


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Uncle Josh Buys An Automobile</FONT></H3></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="jan11-13.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
This record is one of the favorites of Uncle Josh collectors.  Evidently Robert Robinson, one of the cover artists for the Saturday Evening Post, had this record in mind when he drew this delightful illustration for the January 11, 1913 issue.  Although neither Uncle Josh or Cal Stewart is mentioned in the issue, the picture is just perfect - Uncle Josh roaring along with a terrified Aunt Nancy by his side.  We thought you would enjoy seeing this marvelous illustration.</P><BR>
