	<P>We have a booth in the Antique Trove in Roseville, one of the largest antique malls in Northern California. 
	If you are planning a visit, we suggest you allow several hours for browsing, 
	as it is full of many wonderful items besides our records, phonographs and sheet music. 
	The mall is open 7 days a week, from 10 AM to 6 PM. Visit their web 
	site for a map and further information. We are situated on Aisle D, dealer number
	 250. If you can't find our booth, just ask any of the salespeople to direct 
	you to the booth that has all the records and phonographs.<BR>
