<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Something Entirely Different Is Coming Your Way Soon!</H3></FONT></P>

<P>We are pleased to announce an entirely new method of bidding on our auctions.  We call it Direct Bid and it is the easiest and most accurate method of bidding you will find in any record auction.  Simply stated, the auction catalog appears on your computer screen.  It is displayed in an easy-to-read format with occasional pictures of the more interesting items.  You can sort the catalog by lot number, artist, title, or category. <b>*** *Coming Soon* </b>You can also search the catalog by title, artist or label<b>**</b>.  When you find what you want, simply enter your bid right there on the screen, and the bid goes directly into the auction database.  No more bidsheets to fill out and mail in, no need to email or phone in your bids, and no more worrying if your bids were received and entered properly.  There is even a page that shows a <a href="/audio/accounts/bids">summary of your bids</a>, where you can add, delete or edit bids yourself all the way up to the closing date of the auction.<BR><BR>

Please note that we have discontinued our eBid sheet for submitting bids by email. It has been replaced by the <a href="/audio/catalog/simpleForm">Manual Bid</a> feature found in the Online Catalog.  This performs the same function as the old eBid sheet, but eliminates any possible errors made when  copying your bids to the auction database.  And you won't have to fill out your name, address and email each time you bid.<BR><BR>

"But I don't have or use a computer for bidding!" we hear some of you saying.  That's no problem, as we will continue to send out paper catalogs by mail upon request.  And of course the auction catalog will always appear as a PDF file on this website.  So if you choose to mail or phone in your bids, we'll be happy to enter them for you.  You can print a blank bidsheet simply by clicking on the link above.  We want everyone to be able to participate equally in our auctions, so please let us know your preferences as to receiving auction catalogs, placing bids, and receiving invoices for records won.<BR><BR>

Here's a summary of the choices available for our auctions.  When you register as a bidder, please let us know your preferences.<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/static/audio/images/site/photos/strobe.JPG"></CENTER><BR>
Have you ever wondered if your hand wound disc phonograph is running at exactly the right speed?  The most reliable way to test it is to use a strobe disc, and we are now offering a disc that works for both 78 rpm and 80 rpm phonographs.  All you need is a florescent light that runs on 60 cycles (in the USA, that's standard).  Incandescent bulbs may also work, depending on the ambient light conditions in the room.  Instructions are included with the disc.

<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>The Original Nipper Painting</FONT></H3>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/static/audio/images/site/photos/nippercyl.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
Most collectors are familiar with the story of the first Nipper painting.  The artist, Francis Barraud painted Nipper listening to a cylinder phonograph.  He attempted to sell the work to the British division of the Edison company, but was turned down.  He then took the painting to the offices of the Gramophone & Typewriter company and after agreeing to replace the Edison machine with the likeness of a Berliner disc phonograph, he sold the picture which soon became one of the world's best known trademarks.  So, here for your enjoyment, is the original image, showing Nipper listening to a cylinder phonograph.<HR><BR><BR>


<P><H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=RED>Uncle Josh Buys An Automobile</FONT></H3>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/static/audio/images/site/jan11-13.jpg"></CENTER><BR>
This record is one of the favorites of Uncle Josh collectors.  Evidently Robert Robinson, one of the cover artists for the Saturday Evening Post, had this record in mind when he drew this delightful illustration for the January 11, 1913 issue.  Although neither Uncle Josh or Cal Stewart is mentioned in the issue, the picture is just perfect - Uncle Josh roaring along with a terrified Aunt Nancy by his side.  We thought you would enjoy seeing this marvelous illustration.<BR>
